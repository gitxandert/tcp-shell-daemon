# Shell Server

This application sets up a TCP/IP client/server connection and forks clients into their own private shell.

So far, this is just a combination of some UNIX boilerplate, though I'm planning on iterating this into a sort of mini-database, with virtual memory management via mmap() and an LRU paging system.
